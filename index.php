<h1>What is OldPC?</h1>
OldPC is 'Hewlett-Packard HP Pavilion 17 Notebook PC' connected over ethernet cable to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a> router that gives us connection to the internet that is almost twice as fast as standard dial-up internet!
In addition to that, it has an non-water cooling system with "Fan Always On" techonogy (that is impossible to disable in Basic Input/Output System) which keep us on about 40 degrees! It's CPU is 'AMD A8-4500M APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics', also, if you choose to use OldPC as your hosting provider, you will get:
    > Random reboots
    > Unstable and slow network connection
    > Closed ports
    > 600 GB of shared HDD storage
    > 8 GB of RAM
    > Access to camera, on which you can see the router, which is on my attic
    > KVM based virtualization, with os of your choice
    > No warranty of any kind.

No, this is not a joke. Feel free to grab OldPC source from git and setup your own server.
